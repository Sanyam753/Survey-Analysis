280,8.0,"One of the most important things I really like about Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold is its commitment to being USDA Certified Organic. I appreciate that it’s made with organic ingredients, which feels healthier and aligns with my values about sustainability. Knowing that I’m choosing a beer that doesn’t have artificial additives or pesticides is a big plus for me.
Also, the light lager aspect is fantastic! It has a refreshing taste that’s perfect for social occasions or just chilling with friends. It’s super drinkable and doesn’t leave me feeling heavy, which is great for those summer barbecues or after a long day. Plus, the lower calorie count means I can enjoy a couple without feeling guilty.Overall, the combination of organic quality and light, crisp flavor makes Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold a go-to option for me, whether I'm out with friends or just relaxing at home.","mild or one-dimensional compared to some more robust options. I often crave a bit more complexity in the taste, especially if I’m trying to enjoy it with a nice meal.

Another aspect is the availability; I’ve noticed it’s not always easy to find in local stores or bars, especially when compared to more mainstream brands. Sometimes I have to settle for something else because it’s just not stocked.
Lastly, the price point can be a bit higher than other light lagers, which can be a deterrent when I’m looking for something budget-friendly. If it were more widely available and had a more pronounced flavor profile, I’d definitely be more inclined to choose it regularly!",Bud Light,Miller Lite,Miller Lite,0

This aspect not only appeals to health-conscious consumers but also reflects a focus on quality ingredients and sustainability. The light lager's refreshing taste and lower calorie count make it an enjoyable choice for those looking for a guilt-free beer option.,"One thing I dislike about Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold is that its flavor can be somewhat mild and less robust compared to other craft beers. This might make it less appealing for those who prefer a more pronounced taste. Additionally, the price point can be higher than some other light lagers, which may deter budget-conscious consumers.",Corona Premier,Coors Light,Miller Lite,0
